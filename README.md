# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

We are creating a skincare app called Honeydew where users can easily find products by taking a quiz or doing a search & compare different products to find something that best suits their needs.
