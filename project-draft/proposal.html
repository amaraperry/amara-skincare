        <p>
            The beauty industry is booming and there are an overwhelming amount of products available to consumers. This choice overload makes it difficult for people to find products that are suitable for their needs including but not limited to: price, skin type, and ingredients. In an effort to have some guidance, many people turn to social media such as YouTube (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrpQ4p1Ql_hG8rKXIKM1MOQ">beauty channels</a>) or Reddit (e.g., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/">skincare subreddits</a>) to ask for advice and search for answers. However, social media often has the problem of information overload as well.

        <p>
            Skin conditions on the face can affect the quality of life for individuals, making them feel self-conscious, unattractive, and focused on their skin; in a previous study, individuals have reported that their skin condition impacted their daily activities and forced them to put in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724302/">more effort to hiding pigments on their skin</a>. The most common skin conditions are not only difficult to treat, but many abnormal pigmentations, such as melasma, have a high <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724302/">probability for relapse</a> and can appear permanently from changes in hormone balances. The unintended effects from living with physical skin conditions can be detrimental to the mental health of the people that it affects.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are websites such as Sephora that suggest products to users through a <a href="https://www.sephora.com/beauty/skin-care-quiz">skincare quiz</a>, they do not address many areas such as ingredient or cruelty-free preferences. Furthermore, tools such as skin-matching are often brand-specific and do not compare across products from other companies. With so many product options and so little adequate tools, searching for the right product can be exhausting. We hope to alleviate the source of stress by filtering out superfluous information about products and displaying just the right amount of information needed to help users find the perfect product.
